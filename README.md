# Guess-the-Number-Game
*Implement the guess number game using global variables, static variables and functions. Declare a global variable named gussed that keep the track of user guess. Create a function that generate a random number between 1-30 and store in a global variable named guessIt, set the guessed to false and ask the user to guess it. Create a function takeGuess that initialize a static variable tries to 0 and keep track of tries. This function should take a number from user check it against generated number and show user some hints and increment the tries. If user guessed the number then set guessd to true. The main function should call the function to generate a number and the using a while loop to call takeGuess function until user guess the number. When user guess the number then takeGuess function should show number of tires he taken in c++
